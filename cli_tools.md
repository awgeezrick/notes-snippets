# CLI Tools (misc. Mac OSX) - useful notes and commands
----------------------
# Summary
This document contains notes and commands for a misc. set of CLI tools I find useful on Mac OSX. These are geared toward my own learning and use of these tools. Therefore, they are written for my personal reference (i.e. things I don't want to forget) and may have limited relevance to other users.

Tools for which I have created more extensive notes will likely have their own dedicated .md files. If you don't see a particular tool listed below (e.g. `git` or `psql`), check elsewhere in this repository. If it's a tool I use on a regular basis, it may have it's own dedicated .md file.

# exif
This is the ExifTool command-line tool for reading, writing and editing image file metadata including formats EXIF, GPS, IPTC, XMP, JFIF, GeoTIFF, ICC Profile, Photoshop IRB, FlashPix, AFCP and ID3.

Instead of using `find` or `awk` with ExifTool, read the `-ext`, `-if`, `-p` and `-tagsFromFile` options documentation: https://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/exiftool_pod.html
